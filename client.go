// A Client is an HTTP client. Its zero value (DefaultClient) is a
// usable client that uses DefaultTransport.
//
// The Client's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP
// connections), so Clients should be reused instead of created as
// needed. Clients are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// A Client is higher-level than a RoundTripper (such as Transport)
// and additionally handles HTTP details such as cookies and
// redirects.
//
// When following redirects, the Client will forward all headers set on the
// initial Request except:
//
// • when forwarding sensitive headers like "Authorization",
// "WWW-Authenticate", and "Cookie" to untrusted targets.
// These headers will be ignored when following a redirect to a domain
// that is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain.
// For example, a redirect from "foo.com" to either "foo.com" or "sub.foo.com"
// will forward the sensitive headers, but a redirect to "bar.com" will not.
//
// • when forwarding the "Cookie" header with a non-nil cookie Jar.
// Since each redirect may mutate the state of the cookie jar,
// a redirect may possibly alter a cookie set in the initial request.
// When forwarding the "Cookie" header, any mutated cookies will be omitted,
// with the expectation that the Jar will insert those mutated cookies
// with the updated values (assuming the origin matches).
// If Jar is nil, the initial cookies are forwarded without change.

// Get issues a GET to the specified URL. If the response is one of the
// following redirect codes, Get follows the redirect after calling the
// Client's CheckRedirect function:
//
//    301 (Moved Permanently)
//    302 (Found)
//    303 (See Other)
//    307 (Temporary Redirect)
//    308 (Permanent Redirect)
//
// An error is returned if the Client's CheckRedirect function fails
// or if there was an HTTP protocol error. A non-2xx response doesn't
// cause an error.
//
// When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body.
// Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.
//
// To make a request with custom headers, use NewRequest and Client.Do.

// Do sends an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response, following
// policy (such as redirects, cookies, auth) as configured on the
// client.
//
// An error is returned if caused by client policy (such as0
// CheckRedirect), or failure to speak HTTP (such as a network
// connectivity problem). A non-2xx status code doesn't cause an
// error.
//
// If the returned error is nil, the Response will contain a non-nil
// Body which the user is expected to close. If the Body is not
// closed, the Client's underlying RoundTripper (typically Transport)
// may not be able to re-use a persistent TCP connection to the server
// for a subsequent "keep-alive" request.
//
// The request Body, if non-nil, will be closed by the underlying
// Transport, even on errors.
//
// On error, any Response can be ignored. A non-nil Response with a
// non-nil error only occurs when CheckRedirect fails, and even then
// the returned Response.Body is already closed.
//
// Generally Get, Post, or PostForm will be used instead of Do.
//
// If the server replies with a redirect, the Client first uses the
// CheckRedirect function to determine whether the redirect should be
// followed. If permitted, a 301, 302, or 303 redirect causes
// subsequent requests to use HTTP method GET
// (or HEAD if the original request was HEAD), with no body.
// A 307 or 308 redirect preserves the original HTTP method and body,
// provided that the Request.GetBody function is defined.
// The NewRequest function automatically sets GetBody for common
// standard library body types.
